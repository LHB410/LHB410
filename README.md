### Hi there 👋

About me:
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Backend Engineer with K8's, Docker Github actions, Ruby on Rails, and Elastic Search for observability 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a step tracking app that equates your daily step count with Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor and back again, with the goal of making exercise a fun collaborative thing you can do with remote friends.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Hit me up!
- 💬 Ask me about my side projects! I always have something on the side.
- 📫 How to reach me: laura@laurabrooks.codes
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: The nudibranch (a teeny-tiny sea creature) is called umiushi in Japanese, it literally means sea cow. Weird for such a small thing!
