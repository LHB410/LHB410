first craeae the datdabase
then timestap to create a migrateion
then use touch to create a new file in the db/migrate folder

when creating a migrayion use a def change method.
qithin teh method timetsamp is t.timestamp

when referenceing a foreign key use t.references when creating a table i.e

t.references :doctors, foreign_keys: true

then db:migrate

assiciations

if a doctot has many interns you code: "has_many :interns" within teh model

an intern has 1 doctors so therefore : "belongs_to :doctors"

rake console is aplayground where you can test a db and access it.

intern.doctor = doctor

when the need to edit a migration file arrives we need to create a new migration file and remove and add columns. you cannot just edit and migrate.

when adding
Consulation.create!(doctor: doctor, patient: patient)

in order to get a list within a joining table, we have to use "through"

when usuing validation

"validates :last_name, presence: true" - this is the sybtax to make sure its not craeted without this objects presence

to check validation use "doctor.valid?"

to see teh errrors "doctor.errors.full_messages" / "doctor.errors.messages"

vaidates :first_name uniquness: { scope: :last_name }
validates :email, format { with: :regex}
